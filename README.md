# Hypothesis-Testing
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used  in making statistical decision using experimental data. 
Hypothesis testing is basically an assumption that we make about the population parameter. Hypothesis is a starting position that is open to a test and rejection in light of strong adverse evidence. 

Steps includes: 
Define null and Alternative hypothesis. 
Apply t-test or Z-test for testing the validity of the null hypothesis Decide the significance value (Alpha). 
Typical  value used for a is 0.05 Calculate the Probability Value (p-value) 
Take the decision to reject or retain the null hypothesis  based on the p-value and the significance of Alpha.

# Hypothesis Testing on FOUR Business Case

### [1. Cutlet Diameter Significance.](https://github.com/D4Danny/Cutlet-Diameter)
#### Statistic applied: 2 Tail test. 2 Samples.
### [2. Average TAT for Laboratories.](https://github.com/D4Danny/Average-Laboratory-TAT-Test.)
#### Statistic applied: Anova ftest statistics: 
Input(X) is discrete in more than TWO CATEGOTIES. OUT(Y) is Continous
### [3. Male-Female Buying Ratio across regions.](https://github.com/D4Danny/Male-and-Female-Buying-Ratio)
#### Statistic applied: Chi-square test, independence of variables in a contingency table. 
### [4. Defective Form % by Pocessing Centre.](https://github.com/D4Danny/Defective-for-Customer-Form)
#### Statistic applied: Chi-square test.
INPUT(X) Discreet in TWO Categories and OUTPUT(Y) is also discreet
