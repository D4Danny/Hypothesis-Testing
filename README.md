# Hypothesis-Testing
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used  in making statistical decision using experimental data. 
Hypothesis testing is basically an assumption that we make about the population parameter. Hypothesis is a starting position that is open to a test and rejection in light of strong adverse evidence. 

Steps includes: 
Define null and Alternative hypothesis. 
Apply t-test or Z-test for testing the validity of the null hypothesis Decide the significance value (Alpha). 
Typical  value used for a is 0.05 Calculate the Probability Value (p-value) 
Take the decision to reject or retain the null hypothesis  based on the p-value and the significance of Alpha.

# Hypothesis Testing on FOUR Business Case

### [1. Cutlet Diameter Significance.](https://github.com/D4Danny/Cutlet-Diameter)

#### A F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.
#### Statistic applied: 2 Tail test. 2 Samples.

### [2. Average TAT for Laboratories.](https://github.com/D4Danny/Average-Laboratory-TAT-Test.)
#### A hospital wants to determine whether there is any difference in the average Turn Around Time (TAT) of reports of the laboratories on their preferred list. They collected a random sample and recorded TAT for reports of 4 laboratories. TAT is defined as sample collected to report dispatch.
#### Analyze the data and determine whether there is any difference in average TAT among the different laboratories at 5% significance level.
#### Statistic applied: Anova ftest statistics: 
Input(X) is discrete in more than TWO CATEGOTIES. OUT(Y) is Continous

### [3. Male-Female Buying Ratio across regions.](https://github.com/D4Danny/Male-and-Female-Buying-Ratio)
#### Sales of products in four different regions is tabulated for males and females. Find if male-female buyer rations are similar across regions.
#### Statistic applied: Chi-square test, independence of variables in a contingency table. 

### [4. Defective Form % by Pocessing Centre.](https://github.com/D4Danny/Defective-for-Customer-Form)
#### TeleCall uses 4 centers around the globe to process customer order forms. They audit a certain % of the customer order forms. Any error in order form renders it defective and has to be reworked before processing. The manager wants to check whether the defective % varies by centre. Please analyze the data at 5% significance level and help the manager draw appropriate inferences
#### Statistic applied: Chi-square test.
INPUT(X) Discreet in TWO Categories and OUTPUT(Y) is also discreet
